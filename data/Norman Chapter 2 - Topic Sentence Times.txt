00:04.195	4195	1	34	PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY ACTIONS
00:07.462	7462	1	34	During my family's stay in England, we rented a furnished house while the owners were away.
00:44.866	44866	1	34	Falsely Blaming Yourself
00:47.523	47523	1	34	I have studied people making errors—sometimes serious ones—with mechanical devices, light switches and fuses, computer operating sys- tems and word processors, even airplanes and nuclear power plants.
01:31.718	91718	2	35	I once was asked by a large computer company to evaluate a brand new product.
01:53.474	113474	2	35	I pointed this problem out to the designer, explaining that I myself had made the error frequently and that my analyses indicated that this was very likely to be a frequent error among users.
02:13.550	133550	2	35	Yes, yes, I explained, "I understand the two keys, I simply confuse them.
02:32.472	152472	2	35	Nope, said the designer.
02:53.283	173283	2	35	Oh, yes, said the secretaries, "we do that a lot."
02:57.777	177777	2	35	Well, how come nobody ever said anything about it? we asked the secretaries.
03:06.568	186568	2	35	The reason was simple: when the system stopped working or did something strange, the secretaries dutifully reported it as a problem.
03:23.457	203457	2	35	Of course, people do make errors.
03:41.356	221356	3	36	If an error is possible, someone will make it.
04:03.793	243793	3	36	Misconceptions of Everyday Life
04:06.740	246740	3	36	Our lives are filled with misconceptions.
05:00.894	300894	3	36	ARISTOTLE'S NAIVE PHYSICS
05:03.642	303642	3	36	For example, Aristotle thought that moving objects kept moving only if something kept pushing them.
05:58.300	358300	4	37	1. I take a pistol and, carefully aiming it on a level, horizontal line, I fire a bullet.
06:21.871	381871	4	37	2. Imagine someone running across a field carrying a ball.
06:36.290	396290	4	37	The physicist says the answer to the bullet problem is trivial: both bullets hit the ground at the same time.
07:15.831	435831	5	38	In the case of the falling ball, our prediction is that the ball will drop straight down.
07:35.994	455994	5	38	Naive physics—and naive views of psychology and other fields—are often sensible, even if wrong.
07:52.779	472779	5	38	PEOPLE AS EXPLANATORY CREATURES
07:55.688	475688	5	38	Mental models, our conceptual models of the way objects work, events take place, or people behave, result from our tendency to form explana- tions of things.
08:22.710	502710	5	38	Mental models are often constructed from fragmentary evidence, with but a poor understanding of what is happening, and with a kind of naive psychology that postulates causes, mechanisms, and relation- ships even where there are none.
08:59.655	539655	5	38	Consider the room thermostat.
09:39.134	579134	5	38	If you are in a cold room, in a hurry to get warm, will the room heat more quickly if you turn the thermostat all the way up?
10:02.973	602973	6	39	If you think that the room or oven will heat (or cool) faster if the thermostat is turned all the way to the maximum setting, you are wrong.
10:53.236	653236	6	39	The correct story is that the thermostat is just an on-off switch.
11:25.218	685218	6	39	The real point of the example is not that some people have erroneous theories; it is that everyone forms theories (mental models) to explain what they have observed.
11:53.243	713243	6	39	Blaming the Wrong Cause
11:55.658	715658	6	39	Look at this! my colleague exclaimed to me, "My computer termi- nal is broken.
12:11.917	731917	6	39	That doesn't make sense, 1 replied.
12:20.421	740421	7	40	All I know, he said, "is that everything was working fine until I tried to look up an author in the library catalog using that new library program, and then my terminal stopped working.
12:36.638	756638	7	40	Well, it was a coincidence.
12:49.925	769925	7	40	Earlier I suggested that people have a tendency to blame themselves for difficulties with technology.
13:32.054	812054	7	40	Just where do we put the blame for failure?
14:08.897	848897	7	40	One major aspect of the assignment of blame is that we frequently have little information on which to make the judgment, and what little we have may be wrong.
15:04.631	904631	8	41	Interestingly enough, the common tendency to blame ourselves for failures with everyday objects goes against the normal attributions people make.
15:20.491	920491	8	41	Here is a made-up example.
15:38.846	938846	8	41	Now consider Tom's point of view.
16:24.466	984466	8	41	But Tom's colleagues see a different picture.
17:04.702	1024702	8	41	It seems natural for people to blame their own misfortunes on the environment.
17:45.016	1065016	9	42	In all cases, whether a person is inappropriately accepting blame for the inability to work simple objects or attributing behavior to environ- ment or personality, a faulty mental model is at work.
17:58.738	1078738	9	42	LEARNED HELPLESSNESS
18:01.128	1081128	9	42	The phenomenon called learned helplessness may help explain the self- blame.
18:55.070	1135070	9	42	TAUGHT HELPLESSNESS
18:57.260	1137260	9	42	Do the common technology and mathematics phobias result from a kind of learned helplessness?
19:29.794	1169794	9	42	With badly designed objects—constructed so as to lead to misunder- standing—faulty mental models, and poor feedback, no wonder people feel guilty when they have trouble using objects, especially when they perceive (even if incorrectly) that nobody else is …
20:42.672	1242672	10	43	The Nature of Human Thought and Explanation
20:46.064	1246064	10	43	It isn't always easy to tell just where the blame for a problem should be placed.
21:26.975	1286975	10	43	It is spectacularly easy to find examples of false assessment in indus- trial accidents.
21:49.801	1309801	10	43	At the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, operators pushed a button to close a valve; the valve had been opened (properly) to allow excess water to escape from the nuclear core.
22:56.527	1376527	11	44	Similar misinterpretations take place all the time.
24:04.186	1444186	11	44	What happened? The second and third engines were indeed out of oil, and they failed.
24:41.624	1481624	11	44	Why did all three engines fail?
25:34.578	1534578	12	45	I've misinterpreted signals, as I'm sure most people have.
26:31.018	1591018	12	45	Find an explanation, and we are happy.
27:18.278	1638278	12	45	How People Do Things: The Seven Stages of Action
27:22.700	1642700	12	45	I am in Italy, at a conference.
28:30.355	1710355	13	46	What makes something—like threading the projector—difficult to do?
28:44.917	1724917	13	46	The basic idea is simple. To get something done, you have to start with some notion of what is wanted—the goal that is to be achieved.
29:20.335	1760335	13	46	Real tasks are not quite so simple.
29:57.788	1797788	13	46	Suppose I am sitting in my armchair, reading a book.
30:55.755	1855755	15	48	The specific actions bridge the gap between what we would like to have done (our goals and intentions) and all possible physical actions.
31:20.218	1880218	15	48	The evaluation side of things, checking up on what happened, has three stages: first, perceiving what happened in the world; second, trying to make sense of it (interpreting it); and, finally, comparing what happened with what was wanted (figure…
31:37.172	1897172	15	48	There we have it. Seven stages of action: one for goals, three for execution, and three for evaluation.
32:04.455	1924455	15	48	The seven stages form an approximate model, not a complete psycholog- ical theory.
32:45.077	1965077	15	48	For many everyday tasks, goals and intentions are not well specified: they are opportunistic rather than planned.
33:45.037	2025037	16	49	The seven-stage process of action can be started at any point.
34:42.550	2082550	16	49	The Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
34:46.172	2086172	16	49	Remember the movie projector story?
35:27.950	2127950	16	49	The projector story is only an extreme case of the difficulties faced in the conduct of many tasks.
36:05.451	2165451	18	51	THE GULF OF EXECUTION
36:08.113	2168113	18	51	Does the system provide actions that correspond to the intentions of the person?
36:33.930	2193930	18	51	Consider the movie projector example: one problem resulted from the Gulf of Execution.
36:55.703	2215703	18	51	Self-threading projectors do exist.
37:33.412	2253412	18	51	THE GULF OF EVALUATION
37:35.948	2255948	18	51	Does the system provide a physical representation that can be directly perceived and that is directly interpretable in terms of the intentions and expectations of the person?
38:08.460	2288460	18	51	In the movie projector example there was also a problem with the Gulf of Evaluation.
38:31.791	2311791	19	52	But VCRs aren't perfect, either.
39:19.360	2359360	19	52	The gulfs are present to an amazing degree in a variety of devices.
40:04.314	2404314	19	52	The Seven Stages of Action as Design Aids
40:08.651	2408651	19	52	The seven-stage structure can be a valuable design aid, for it provides a basic checklist of questions to ask to ensure that the Gulfs of Evalua- tion and Execution are bridged (figure…
40:21.697	2421697	19	52	In general, each stage of action requires its own special design strate- gies and, in turn, provides its own opportunity for disaster.
40:50.694	2450694	19	52	• Visibility.
40:58.332	2458332	20	53	• A good conceptual model.
41:12.061	2472061	20	53	• Good mappings.
41:25.350	2485350	20	53	• Feedback.
41:32.670	2492670	20	53	Each point provides support for one or more of the seven stages of action.
